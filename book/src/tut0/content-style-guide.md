## Content principles

### The audience

The audience is assumed to be junior programmers wanting to learn how to write games with amethyst.

### Always show with clear examples

Business rules add a lot of noise. Include examples as well as implementation.

### Don't skip trivial steps

In my third year calculus III, when solving problems on the board, my prof would do integration by parts as trivial step, giving no mentioned at all to why or how the entire formula completely changed from one line to the next.  He was a genius and a good professor, but nobody learned anything because we all got hung up and totally lost on, what was to him, was a trivial step.

When ever anything is changed.  List why explicitly.
