# Tutorial 0: Preparing for a software project

The first step of any software project, that has any chance of being sucessful, is planning.

I've set two major deliverables for this project:

1. A working and complete game
2. A set of tutorials

I'd obvious like both to be as high a quality as possible, so I'll need plans for each.

### 1. Developing a complete game

Developing software is tricky business. Software by its nature is very fluid, and it changes drastically during its development. This manifests during development into strange existencial like "what is it we're building?" and "when do we know it's done?".

There's a saying about software development, you don't finish a piece of software, you just stop working on it.

This means, that if I want to say, I'm going to deliver a complete game, I'm going to first define what a complete game is.

This is done through the writing of requirements.




### 2. Develop a set of useful tutorials
