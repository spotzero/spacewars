# Spacewars

## Overview

I wanted to learn how to use the Amethyst Game Engine and improve my rust, so I decided to implement a game that I fondly remember from my childhood: **Spacewar!**.

**Spacewar!** has the honour of also being one of the very first computer game ever written, so it seems like a logical place to start when learning to use a game engine.

I've also decided to document my development of Spacewars as a Amethyst tutorial, because the existing tutorials I've found didn't take you very far into the engine and the "2d startkit" doesn't start you with very much at all.

The master branch will contain the finished game. The code for each tutorials chapter will be in their own branches.

## Tutorials

I'm breaking each tutorial up into chapters of the feature that I'm implementing. I'll assume you've skimmed the Amethyst book, looked at the pong tutorial, and even tried out some of the examples.

I'm assuming that because that's where I was when I started writting this.

Chapters:

1. Creating an initial game space
2. Adding ships
2. Accepting Input
3. Making ships fly around
4. Fireing missles
5. Adding a gravity well
6. Collisions
7. Respawning and score keeping
8. Sound
9. Ship energy and health
10. Energy recharging
11. Pausing
12. Damage animation
13. Adding a menu
14. Particle effects: Engines, damage, and explosions
15. Adding lasers
16. Adding hyper space
