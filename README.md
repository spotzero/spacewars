# Spacewars

## Overview

I wanted to learn how to use the Amethyst Game Engine and improve my rust, so I decided to implement a game that I fondly remember from my childhood: **Spacewar!**.

**Spacewar!** has the honour of also being one of the very first computer game ever written, so it seems like a logical place to start when learning to use a game engine.
